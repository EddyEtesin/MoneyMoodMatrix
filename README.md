# 🌍 Money vs Happiness – *An Analytical Dive into Global Well-Being*

**Does money really buy happiness?** This project explores that timeless question using real-world data and Python-based data analysis techniques. We look at the relationship between GDP, life satisfaction, social support, and other factors that contribute to national happiness levels.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook analyzes a dataset containing various well-being indicators across countries and years, such as:

- **Life Ladder** (a measure of happiness)
- **Log GDP per capita**
- **Social support**
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**
- **Perceptions of corruption**
- **Positive affect**
- and more...

Through grouping, sorting, and visual exploration, we uncover how happiness varies across countries and whether economic prosperity guarantees a more fulfilled life.

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

- Which countries are the happiest and least happy over time?
- How closely is **income (GDP per capita)** related to **life satisfaction**?
- What other factors (e.g., health, corruption, social support) influence happiness?
